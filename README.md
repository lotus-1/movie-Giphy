Enter [here](https://lotus-1.github.io/movie-Giphy-/) to see our super page
<br>

We built our application to let the user search for their favourite movies and TV-shows. The user can get information about the movie, like the release date, movie summary and rate. :cinema:

<br>
We used API, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, HTML5, DOM technologies to build our app<br>

<br>
this page has 2 results to the button . when you search about a movie you got the move poster and information and also a anmation giphy from the movie
<br>
Some of the challenges we encountered are, finding the API key, finding the image URL, working on a project that somwone else did, and updating it.

<br>
If we were going to continue working on this application, we would add a trailer to the movie, and more search options, like searching for actors.
hope you like it :heart:
